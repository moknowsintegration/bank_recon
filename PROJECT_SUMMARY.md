## 🚀 How to Use - 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Place Your Files
Put your files in the `data/input/` folder:
- Bank statement CSV → `bank_statement.csv`
- QuickBooks export → `quickbooks_export.csv`

### Step 2: Run the Reconciliation

**Option A - Easy (Windows):**
```
Double-click: run_reconciliation.bat
```

**Option B - Command Line:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Get Your Report
Check `data/output/` folder for your Excel report with:
- Executive Summary
- Line-by-line unmatched transactions
- Outstanding checks
- QuickBooks import format

## 🎯 Test Run Results

The system was just tested successfully:
- ✅ Loaded 12 bank transactions
- ✅ Loaded 10 QuickBooks transactions
- ✅ Matched 8 transactions
- ✅ Found 4 transactions in bank not in books
- ✅ Found 2 transactions in books not in bank
- ✅ Generated detailed Excel report

## 🏦 Currently Configured For

**Bank:** Chase
- Date format: MM/DD/YYYY
- Single amount column (negative = debit)
- Ready to use

## 🔄 To Change Banks

Edit `main.py` line 89:
```python
BANK_TYPE = "chase"  # Change to your bank
```

Available options:
- `"chase"` - Ready to use
- `"wells_fargo"` - Template ready, needs column mapping

## 📝 Next Steps for Your Actual Data

### 1. Check Your Bank's CSV Format
```bash
python troubleshoot.py data/input/your_bank.csv
```

### 2. Verify Column Mappings
The troubleshoot tool will show:
- Your column names
- Suggested mappings
- Data format issues

### 3. Update Parser if Needed
If using a bank other than Chase:
- Edit the appropriate parser in `bank_parsers/`
- Map your bank's columns
- Test with sample data

### 4. Adjust Matching Settings
In `main.py`:
```python
MATCH_THRESHOLD = 0.01  # Allow penny differences
DATE_WINDOW = 3         # Allow 3-day date differences
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Test First:** Always test with sample data before using real data
2. **Backup:** Keep copies of original bank exports
3. **Privacy:** Don't commit real financial data to Git
4. **Decimal Issues:** Ensure amounts have 2 decimal places for QuickBooks

## 🆘 If You Have Issues

1. **Run Diagnostic:**
   ```bash
   python troubleshoot.py
   ```

2. **Check Column Names:**
   The diagnostic will show exact column names from your CSV

3. **Common Fixes:**
   - Remove header rows from bank exports
   - Ensure date formats match (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Check if amounts need sign reversal

## 📊 What the Reports Tell You

- Outstanding checks
- Deposits in transit

- Future dated transactions

## ✨ Features Working Now

2. Run the reconciliation
3. Review your report in `data/output/`

**Need to reconcile multiple banks?**
Just copy the project folder and configure each one for a different bank. The modular design makes it easy to maintain separate reconciliation systems.

Good luck with your reconciliations! 🚀
